abstract = {2016 ICST. Mobile application developers are using cryptography in their products to protect sensitive data like passwords, short messages, documents etc. In this paper, we study whether cryptography and related techniques are employed in a proper way, in order to protect these private data. To this end, we downloaded 49 Android applications from the Google Play marketplace and performed static and dynamic analysis in an attempt to detect possible cryptographic misuses. The results showed that 87.8{\%} of the applications present some kind of misuse, while for the rest of them no cryptography usage was detected during the analysis. Finally, we suggest countermeasures, mainly intended for developers, to alleviate the issues identified by the analysis.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the Web interfaces of several DSL home routers that can be used to manage their settings via a Web browser. Our goal is to change these settings by using primary XSS and UI redressing attacks. This study evaluates routers from 10 different manufacturers (TP-Link, Netgear, Huawei, D-Link, Linksys, LogiLink, Belkin, Buffalo, Fritz!Box, and Asus). We were able to circumvent the security of all of them. To demonstrate how all devices are able to be attacked, we show how to do fast fingerprinting attacks. Furthermore, we provide countermeasures to make administration interfaces and therefore the use of routers more secure.},

abstract = {2017 IEEE. Recently, advances in cyber-physical systems and IoT led to an increase in devices connected to the internet. This rise of functionality also comes with an increased attack surface for cyber criminals. A proven method for forensic investigations of trends and developments in crimes conducted in the virtual world are honeypots. We set up a medium interaction honeypot offering telnet and SSH services. With this honeypot we captured data from attack sessions. This data was used for statistical and behavioural analysis, such as distributions of attacks and different attacker IPs, originating countries, employed anonymisation services, skill level of an adversary and commonly targeted embedded devices. Furthermore, machine learning techniques that are capable of identifying unique types of sessions based on issued commands and provided credentials are presented in this work. There are strong indicators that most of the traffic captured during our research is caused by botnet activities, which corresponds to findings of different research activities.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) market has begun to take off. Consumers can buy connected
versions of nearly every household appliance available. However, despite its increasing
acceptance by consumers, recent studies of IoT devices seem to agree that "security" is not
a word that gets associated with this category of devices, leaving consumers potentially
exposed.
To find out for ourselves how IoT devices fare when it comes to security, we analyzed 50
smart home devices that are available today. We found that none of the devices enforced
strong passwords, used mutual authentication, or protected accounts against brute-force
attacks. Almost two out of ten of the mobile apps used to control the tested IoT devices did
not use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt communications to the cloud. The tested IoT
technology also contained many common vulnerabilities.
All of the potential weaknesses that could afflict IoT systems, such as authentication and
traffic encryption, are already well known to the security industry, but despite this, known
mitigation techniques are often neglected on these devices. IoT vendors need to do a better
job on security before their devices become ubiquitous in every home, leaving millions of
people at risk of cyberattacks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that involves connecting endpoint devices and physical objects to the Internet. While IoT is envisioned to dramatically increase convenience in our daily lives, it could also result in catastrophic economic and safety issues. Considering the applications envisioned for IoT (smart cities, homes, retail, etc.), security must be handled with great care and should start from the bottom up (i.e., from the hardware level). As a good deal of IoT devices require interaction between devices and humans, biometrics provide an interesting opportunity for improving both the convenience and security in IoT applications. In this paper, we consider the potential benefits and challenges associated with incorporating biometrics into IoT. We combine novel biometrics, such as ECG and PPG, and system-level obfuscation approaches to prevent reverse engineering, tampering and unauthorized access of IoT devices and other electronic systems. Our preliminary results are promising and motivate future work in this area.},

We present two categories of attacks against smart locks and analyze the security of five commercially-available locks with respect to these attacks. Our security analysis reveals that flaws in the design, implementation, and interaction models of existing locks can be exploited by several classes of adversaries, allowing them to learn private information about users and gain unauthorized home access. To guide future development of smart locks and similar Internet of Things devices, we propose several defenses that mitigate the attacks we present. One of these defenses is a novel approach to securely and usably communicate a user's intended actions to smart locks, which we prototype and evaluate. Ultimately, our work takes a first step towards illuminating security challenges in the system design and novel functionality introduced by emerging IoT systems. 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

@article{Fernandes2016,
abstract = {Recently, several competing smart home program-ming frameworks that support third party app development have emerged. These frameworks provide tangible benefits to users, but can also expose users to significant security risks. This paper presents the first in-depth empirical security analysis of one such emerging smart home programming platform. We analyzed Samsung-owned SmartThings, which has the largest number of apps among currently available smart home platforms, and supports a broad range of devices including motion sensors, fire alarms, and door locks. SmartThings hosts the application runtime on a proprietary, closed-source cloud backend, making scrutiny challenging. We overcame the challenge with a static source code analysis of 499 SmartThings apps (called SmartApps) and 132 device handlers, and carefully crafted test cases that revealed many undocumented features of the platform. Our key findings are twofold. First, although SmartThings implements a privilege separation model, we discovered two intrinsic design flaws that lead to significant overprivilege in SmartApps. Our analysis reveals that over 55{\%} of SmartApps in the store are overprivileged due to the capabilities being too coarse-grained. Moreover, once installed, a SmartApp is granted full access to a device even if it specifies needing only limited access to the device. Second, the SmartThings event subsystem, which devices use to communicate asynchronously with SmartApps via events, does not sufficiently protect events that carry sensitive information such as lock codes. We exploited framework design flaws to construct four proof-of-concept attacks that: (1) secretly planted door lock codes; (2) stole existing door lock codes; (3) disabled vacation mode of the home; and (4) induced a fake fire alarm. We conclude the paper with security lessons for the design of emerging smart home programming frameworks.},

Recent Internet of Things (IoT) botnet attacks have called the attention to the fact that there are many vulnerable IoT devices connected to the Internet today. Some of these Web-connected devices lack even basic security practices such as strong password authentication. As a consequence, many IoT devices are already infected with malware and many more are vulnerable to exploitation. In this paper we analyze the security level of 16 popular IoT devices. We evaluate several low-cost black-box techniques for reverse engineering these devices, including software and fault injection-based techniques used to bypass password protection. We use these techniques to recover device firmware and passwords. We also discover several common design flaws which lead to previously unknown vulnerabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by modifying a laboratory version of the Mirai botnet to automatically add these devices to a botnet. We also discuss how to improve the security of IoT devices without significantly increasing their cost or affecting their usability.},

Based on this view, we systematically present security and privacy requirements in terms of IoT system, software, networking and big data analytics in the cloud. Second, using the end-to-end view of IoT security and privacy, we present a vulnerability analysis of the Edimax IP camera system. We are the first to exploit this system and have identified various attacks that can fully control all the cameras from the manufacturer. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered attacks and raise the alarms again for the IoT manufacturers. Third, such vulnerabilities found in the exploit of Edimax cameras and our previous exploit of Edimax},
